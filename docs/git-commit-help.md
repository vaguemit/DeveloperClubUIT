# Git Commit Message Help

## When stuck in Vim editor during commit:

1. **Enter insert mode:**
```
i
```

2. **Write your message**, for example:
```
Update codeforces leaderboard with expert rank
```

3. **Exit insert mode:**
```
Esc
```

4. **Save and quit:**
```
:wq
```

## To abort commit:
```
:q!
```

## Tips for good commit messages:
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Start with a capital letter
- Don't end with a period
